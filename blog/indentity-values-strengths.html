    <h1>indentity values and strengths</h1>
    <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.</h3>
    <p>
      My first car developed an 'engine rattle'. My mechanic friend informed me
      it was likely that the engine was on the way out which would total the
      car. He also mentioned he knew a method to temporarily hide the knock by
      putting a thicker oil in it, which would allow me to sell it for normal
      market value. If I listed it for sale disclosing the knock I would have
      gotten essentially scrap value. The benifit of doing this meant more money
      in my empty student pockets to buy another car. However I would know I had
      sold someone a financial time-bomb. Regardless of the financial position
      of the buyer, tricking someone like that for monetary gain does not sit
      right with me, and so I sold it for scrap. Even though I may have winced
      at the lost money, I know I made the right call according to my values.

    <h3>
      Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
      values and identity.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I come from a familial line of cowboys and loggers. This has given me a
      sense of self-reliance (perhaps to a fault). Many of my close friends I
      have known since highschool, and they are very empathetic and accepting to
      many different types of people. My friends have taught me deep and long
      lasting friendship is incredibly valuble, and not quickly built, as well
      as the beauty of diversity.

    <h3>
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning
      journey.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My greatest strength is my eagerness to learn new things. I love to get
      lost in new concepts and exploring the ways I can implement them and shape
      them with my own perspective and creativity. I also consider myself a fast
      learner in a practical setting. Once I can get my hands on the tools I
      learn quickly, being able to mess around and make mistakes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
      development. How might these affect your learning journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
      My greatest limitation is my ability to self moderate and hold myself
      accountable. I will often spend too much time on one thing and neglect
      others even if they are equally important. If I dont enjoy what I am doing
      I find it hard to make myself do it. This can become a big problem if I
      start to fall behind on a project as this compounds on itself. Aside from
      learning to code, teaching myself to self moderate and stay focused will
      be my biggest challenge.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others,
      but there was resistance or tension.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Working as a chef at my last job, one of my seniors was pretty
      'micro-managy'. While I valued their expereince, constant reminders of
      small mistakes I had already learned to avoid really dug at my confidence
      and made me less effective. After a few busy shifts I decided to talk to
      them one on one and voice my issues with their managment style. This
      worked, as we are both reasonable people and aware we have flaws. We ended
      up becoming a great team and even friends.
