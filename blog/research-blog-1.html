    <h3>Margin, Boarder and Padding!</h3>

    <p>
      Margin, boarder and padding are tools we can use to control the shape and
      spacing of different content "boxes" within a website page. Before popping
      open the hood and getting technical, lets start with an analogy!
    </p>
    <div>
      <img
        src="/cody-ilg.github.io/styles/Images/css-box.png"
        alt="box model example"
      />
    </div>
    <p>
      Imagine you are managing a warehouse filled with boxes. The contents of a
      box, say a Limited edition golden thanos Funko Popâ„¢, is the core. We want
      to protect our collectable, so we put some packaging around Thanos. This
      is the padding. Our boarder is the box itself, and can be made as thick as
      we want. The boarder can also be invisible! The margin is the space we
      leave between our box and other boxes aswell as the walls of the shelve.
