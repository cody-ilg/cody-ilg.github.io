    <h3>How can understanding neuroplasticity benefit you?</h3>
    <p>
      It can be disheartening to feel stuck in a bad habit you feel you have no
      control over. Realising we have control over our mental habits and can
      change them can restore agency to yourself!
    </p>
    <h3>How can you increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>
      Doing small tasks often and repeating the same ones can strengthen the
      associated neroun connections. The more you do the stronger the pathways
      get and the easier it becomes.
    </p>
    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>
      A growth mindset is viewing aspects of your mind you wish to change as
      changable! Your minds abilities are not fixed, and even though you may
      feel its not where you want it to be, you can change that and improve.
    </p>
    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
    <p>
      Understanding neuroplasticity should empower you to take small steps to
      change yourself. By understanding how your mind can adapt, you are no
      longer shackled by self doubt or feelings of helplessness.
