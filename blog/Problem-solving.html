    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <h3>A simple solution</h3>
    <p>
      While doing the Whack-A-Mole excercise, I couldn't work out why a part of
      my code was not working. The excersice asks you to write some code to make
      a mole pop out of a random hole, and go to a different one once you click
      it. My problem was that the mole was not 'registering' my clicks. I tried
      moving code around and changing some of it but nothing worked. It turned
      out I had a peice of code in the wrong place. I moved it over and the code
      worked. What I took away from this is to always try the simplest fixes
      first, such as spelling errors and syntax.
    </p>
    <h3>An elegant solution</h3>
    <p>
      During the JS kata excercise, I was struggling to understand 'for loops'.
      For Loops are a peice of code used to repeat a function a given number of
      times. They are useful for 'automating' certain tasks and reducing the
      need to repeat tasks when only making incremental differences. My solution
      was to go back to previous material and do it again. This not only
      refreshed my mind, but reenforced how a for loop functions and what they
      are used for.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I feel about different problem solving processes?</h3>

    <li>
      Pseudocode I havn't used much aside from temporarily disabling code to
      test.
    </li>
    <li>
      Trying something is one of my favourite ways to learn. I enjoy getting my
      hands dirty!
    </li>
    <li>Rubber ducky method is a habit I would like to use more.</li>
    <li>
      Reading error messages is very useful as it tells you which line is giving
      problems. Although figuring out why can be harder.
    </li>
    <li>
      Console.logging is agreat tool. When i am writing code for an excercise I
      console.log every peice to check its working.
    </li>
    <li>Googling is my first line of defence.</li>
    <li>
      Asking your peers for help is somthing I under utilised in foundations. I
      hope to do this much more in bootcamp!
    </li>
    <li>
      Asking coaches for help I also didnt do enough of. Getting to meet
      (almost) everyone face to face will push me to do this more.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improving your process with reflection has been a great way to help
      'settle' new concepts.
