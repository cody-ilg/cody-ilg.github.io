    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
    <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      My long term goal is to enter the software development industry.
      Additionally, I would love to learn game development as a hobby to
      compliment my development skills. The most important thing to me is that I
      can make somthing people enjoy and contribute a peice of my creativity to
      the wider world.

    <h3>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      Strengths
    </h3>
    <p>
      I am a quick, practical and eager learner. I enjoy exploring concepts
      untill I have a broad understanding of how they work. Limitations: A big
      thing that holds me back is perseverance. I am great at starting things
      but struggle to see them through and stay focused. I have trouble asking
      for help and recognising when I am slipping.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      The ability to keep myself accountable, If I come out of Dev Academy
      having a stronger will to do what I need to do I will be stoked.
    </p>
    <h3>My commitments to manage my workload and improve</h3>
    <p>
      I need to be better at asking for help when I recognise I am falling
      behind. Once I become blocked on a problem I will reach out to my peers or
      a facilitator for help. My time managment needs to become more structured.
      I will block dedicated times for breaks and work.
