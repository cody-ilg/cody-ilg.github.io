.What is your long term goal or career pathway? My long term goal is to enter
the software development industry. Additionally, I would love to learn game
development as a hobby to compliment my development skills. The most important
thing to me is that I can make somthing people enjoy and contribute a peice of
my creativity to the wider world. A description of your strengths and
limitations when it comes to learning Strengths: -I am a quick, practical and
eager learner. -I enjoy exploring concepts untill I have a broad understanding
of how they work. Limitations: -A big thing that holds me back is perseverance.
I am great at starting things but struggle to see them through and stay focused.
-I have trouble asking for help and recognising when I am slipping. What skills
(non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself
while at Dev Academy? The ability to keep myself accountable, If I come out of
Dev Academy having a stronger will to do what I need to do I will be stoked. A
commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should
include: -I need to be better at asking for help when I recognise I am falling
behind. Once I become blocked on a problem I will reach out to my peers or a
facilitator for help. -My time managment needs to become more structured. I will
block dedicated times for breaks and work.
