    <h1>Core Reflections, my Foundations Journey</h1>
    <h3>What I learned about myself</h3>
    <p>
      From the core learning I became more aware of my strengths, and how I
      could improve on my weak points. I can be overconfident, and underestimate
      how much time somthing will take. I also learnt I can change my behaviour
      by having a 'growth mindset' and thinking positively about change.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming
    </h3>
    <p>
      Programming, like all things requires you to look after yourself and
      others. You need to be sure you are fair to your peers and yourself, and
      maintain a healthy mind, body and soul.
    </p>
    <h3>What suprised you most about core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The amount of work needed to implement all of it into your work and life!
      I plan to work on the core material covered in foundation through
      bootcamp, and take it to the rest of my life as well.
    </p>
    <h3>What was challenging about core learning?</h3>
    <p>
      The most challenging thing for me was leaving enough time for it. I
      focused mainly on the tech, and if I could do it again I would have taken
      the core more seriously as I stand to benifit greatly from the material.
      In particular thinking like a programmer and mindfulness.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why do you think we are spending so much time on core learning in a web
      development Bootcamp course?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because Dev Academy aims to teach me how to be a human who can work in a
      team, on projects and in the workplace. Learning is code is a huge part of
      that, but if i dont have core human skills and self awarness it may not do
      me much good.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time?
    </h3>
    <p>
      No. I feel personally the core skills taught are just as important for me
      as the codeing. I recognise that I need the solid foundation of my self in
      order to learn and eventually begin my carrer in development. I have
      enjoyed and benefitted exploring the aspects of myself, and practising
      ways to better myself.
