    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
    <h3>JS, HTML and CSS? What do they do?</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript (or JS), HTML and CSS all come together to make a webpage,
      fufilling different roles. Lets say you have made a puppet! Making the
      skeleton of the puppet is the HTML, this gives it structure, like legs,
      arms a head and body. CSS is the clothes you dress the puppet in, like a
      pirate costume for example. With those two elements we do indeed have a
      nice looking puppet, but he doesnt do very much. Thats where we bring in
      JS, the strings. With JS we can animate the puppet and make him come
      alive! Even though our puppet is still a puppet without his strings, and
      they are not required, hes much more exciting wwith them.

    <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
    <p>
      Control flow is how your computer runs JS code from top to bottom, untill
      it hits a conditional or a loop. Conditionals are basic logic like an 'if'
      statment. Loops are conditions we can put in code that will run a
      specified number of times for a specified reason. Some examples would be:
    </p>
    <li>
      "for loop:" A for loop is like an angry manager texting an employee who
      didnt show up for work. In this case the manager will keep texting the
      employee until the condition of "Sent 5 texts" is met.
    </li>
    <li>
      "While loop:" A while loop is like the same angry manager texting the
      employee until the condition of "Employee texts back" is met. He doesnt
      know how long this will take but he keeps trying untill the condition is
      met.
    </li>
    <li>
      "if statment:" And if statment simply means, only do "X" if "Y" is true.
      This is like our manager texting the employee once the condition of
      "Employee not at work" is true. He will only do this once unless he is
      prodded by a manager or placed in a "for loop" (The analogy has begun to
      break down).
    </li>

    <h3>The DOM</h3>
    <p>
      The document object model, or DOM, is like an address book for a web page.
      The different are houses, and the houses are split onto streets. To add an
      object, or house to the DOM, it needs an address. We can then use the DOM
      to access the different houses down different streets.
    </p>
    <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Arrays and Objects are ways to identify and access data. An array is a
      string of numbers or values, and an Object has a unique ID. Going back to
      our address book example, lets say we had a row of houses that had yet to
      be numbered or identified. If we put them into an array, They would be
      given house numbers from 0 to to total number of houses -1 (we count from
      0 in programming!). If we assigned them as objects, they would not have a
      house number but instead each a unique name, in no way associated with the
      house to either side.
    </p>
    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>
      A function, in its simplest form, takes an input, performs a task and
      produces an output. Think of it like a chef! Raw ingredients are the input
      (eggs, oil, lemon juice and mustard), the recipie is the function (blitz
      the ingredients), and the dish is the output (mayonaise!).
