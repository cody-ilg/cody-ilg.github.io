IQ and EQ. What are they? IQ, or intellegence quotient, is a measure of your
reasoning ability and intellegence. Using standardised tests, it gauges how good
you are at problem solving, logic, rational deduction and reasoning. EQ, or
emotional quotient, is your ability to understand and manage your own emotions
as well as communicate them to others. A person with high EQ will have strong
empathy, adaptable behaviour and be able to resolve conflicts.
