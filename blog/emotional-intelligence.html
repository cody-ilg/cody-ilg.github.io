    <h1>IQ and EQ. What are they?</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>
      IQ, or intellegence quotient, is a measure of your reasoning ability and
      intellegence. Using standardised tests, it gauges how good you are at
      problem solving, logic, rational deduction and reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      EQ, or emotional quotient, is your ability to understand and manage your
      own emotions as well as communicate them to others. A person with high EQ
      will have strong empathy, adaptable behaviour and be able to resolve
      conflicts.

      see what a basic implementation of them would look like.
