    <h1>Margin, Boarder and Padding! The CSS box model</h1>
    <h3></h3>
    <p>
      The CSS box model describes the box that wraps around every HTML element
      on a page. Margin, boarder and padding are tools we can use to control the
      shape and spacing of these html element "boxes". Before popping open the
      hood and getting more technical, lets start with an analogy!
    </p>
    <img class="imgcentre" src="Images/css-box.png" alt="box model example" />
    <p>
      Imagine your website page is actually a warehouse filled with boxes. The
      contents of a box, say a Limited edition golden thanos Funko Popâ„¢, is the
      content (text or images). We want to protect our collectable, so we put
      some packaging around Thanos. This is the padding, which dictates how much
      space is between Thanos and the box he is contained in. Our boarder is the
      box itself, and can be made as thick or thin as we want, or even
      invisible! The margin is the empty space we leave between our box and
      other boxes around it, aswell as the walls (edge of the page).

      Now we have a basic understanding of the three parts of a CSS box, lets
      see what a basic implementation of them would look like.

    <div>
      <img class="examplecoderight" src="Images/egcode.png" />
      <p class="examplebox">
        The code above defines a css box that looks a bit like this.
