    <h1>Te Whare Tapa Whā</h1>
    <h3>
      Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing developed by
      Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on health.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The 4 dimensions are: taha tinana (physical wellbeing), taha hinengaro
      (mental wellbeing), taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing) and taha whānau
      (family wellbeing). The 4 dimensions represent the 4 walls of a
      wharenui(communal house).
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      To care for my physical wellbeing, I signed up for a gym membership when I
      started foundations, I plan to go atleast twice a week. During foundations
      I also took one short walk a day on my break, and will walk to and from
      bootcamp(weather permitting). I have also cut way down on alcohol and big
      nights out, to save more of myself for the waking hours.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      Taking what I learned about neuroplasticity, I will continue to make small
      changes to my daily habits. these include, feeling proud of myself for
      completing a task and taking mindfulness breaks. Instead of feeling sad
      over failures, I will use them as an opportunity to understand what went
      wrong, and think about how to avoid the same mistake.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      Nature is very important to my spiritual wellbeing, especially spending so
      much time on screens. I often go for drives on the weekend to the south
      coast, or kapiti to spend some time away from my usual setting.
    </p>
    <h3>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</h3>
    <p>
      My family lives in Wellington and I have been making an effort to see them
      once a week and tell them how I am going. I will spend a few nights a week
      staying at my partners, whom is very supportive of me.
    </p>
    <h3>Whenua- Interconnections to the land and environment</h3>
    <p>
      When I am in nature, be it just sitting or going for a walk. I make a
      concious effort not to check my phone and take it as a chance to really
      pay attention to our beautiful aoeteroa.
